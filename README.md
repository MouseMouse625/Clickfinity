## Clickfinity

Hello! This is a minimalistic Python based clicker game, called Clickfinity. It has a ton of gameplay for you to play through. There is also an easter egg hidden within the game, and good luck finding it. There are SFX, and credits to Mixit for providing the SFX, as well as to Arulo for being the artist of the music in the easter egg. Good luck.
